  <div id="left-content">      
      <p>The MarklinStop.com website is produced by Paul as a hobby project to circulate information about Marklin trains and the history of the Marklin company.  A team of moderators, authors, and participants also help run the website and make it fun and enjoyable.  My mission (along with many other collectors and enthusiasts on this site) is to look at Marklin not only as a toy manufacturer, but a thread in the last 150+ years of history.  A discussion about Marklin might on the surface be about toys and trains and at a deeper level be about the devistating impacts of war, the survivability of businesses, or the economics of collectibles.  That is not to say one's hobby of collecting toys must deal with such deep and heavy discussions but certainly these things are interesting to think about and add a level of complexity to the toys and trains we collect and enjoy.
